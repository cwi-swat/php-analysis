%% There are two kind of documents:
%%  1) Document with PHP possible surrounded by HTML
%%     This document has an optional end-tag. The reason why
%%     we prefer a seperate consturctor with different amount of childeren is
%%     because optional end-tag with optional InlineHtml does not make any
%%     sense.
%%  2) Document without PHP. Only InlineHTML or InlineEcho's
%%     This document is a TemplateDocument because it is 
%%     Likely to be a webpage with only some variables injected
%%     in it.
